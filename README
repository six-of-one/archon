Game play:

Philosophy -

The mod is intended to be played with most new features turned on.
Cubes and crates are designed as an add in vector for new weapons and items.
The morph cubes enable polymorph and must be active to release the "Archon spirit"
Nodules must be turned on to power archons spell energy and assist in becoming an archon.

Become an Archon -

Experience points (XP) are awarded for: item / treasure collection, monster kills, and using runes / artifacts.
Once you amass some XP, find the Archon Altar (currently appears as a waving flag) and touch it.
The Altar converts XP to archon points.  Power points (includes portable) provide direct
archon points while touching them (or holding the portable.)

Once you have a few hundered archon points, you can use any morph cube to take on other forms and
gain more archon points.  By the time at least one player has more than 5000 archon points,
the "Archon Spirit" should be on the level.  Archon Spirit currently appears as smaller 3D uber
chaos icon - four 8 ray stars intersected.  Touch this and select your Archon choice - Chaos or Order.

Faster method - find the "God Particle" - has the appearance of an M.C. Escher construct -
three hollow 8 sided golden polygons that intersect.  Touching the God particle gives you
mega amounts of archon points and XP.

Using Archon spells - 

Spells are selected with weapon impulses (bound to 1 - 8).
Initial spells are attack (impulse 1) and teleport self / make vessel (impulse 2).
To cast more spells, you must have a minimum of 2000 points to make a Soul vessel.
When you have enough points the "make a vessel" spell gives you a reticle to select the
location of your vessel.  Additional spells can add or remove points from a vessel.
You can also rescind the vessel, and recover its points.

Hints:

Convert XP to archon points as soon as possible.  Archon points follow you to the next level -
XP do not.  The earlier you convert XP, the more archon points you will get.  The conversion
rate decays with altar usage by powers of 2.  The first one to the altar gets better conversion rates.
Also look for "portable" power points - smaller versions of the hubs 5 power points.
You can carry them with you - they provide small amounts of archon points every second
and protect you from Archon spell targeting.

The God particle is (meant to be) hard to find, but well worth it.  Finding the GP should be
an Archons secondary goal - always.

Morphed players should (again are "meant to") get more XP from built in weapons use and natural magic.

Archons get a lot more archon points from power points and nodules.
(Non Archons only get XP from nodules - Archons have direct conversion.)
Archons can NOT convert XP to archon points and thus have no need of XP.

5000 points is the minimum to become an Archon.  You will need more for spells.

Some spells require more points added to your Soul vessel.

Game glossary and descriptions:


Consult visual guide for images.

Archon: Chaos or Order - becoming one is the point of the mod.

Archon spirit: this is a special morph cube that allows a player to become an Archon.
(You must posses enough archon points - 5000 at this time.  You need a lot more.)

Soul vessel: a gem or other item where an Archon stores points.
One is required for casting more powerful spells.

God particle: a special nodule that gives a large quantity of archon points.

Altar: touching an altar converts experience points to archon points.
You get XP for: collecting items, possesing runes and artifacts, killing monsters.
The only thing that directly gives archon points to non archons are power points.
As of now, altars appear in game as flags.

Painkeep cube: beveled edges, has pk symbol on it.  Touch it, and press fire - you
must be in range.  Select another weapon to free the cube.  PK cubes give weapons, items, monsters
and might be trapped.

Morphic cube: beveled edges, glowing interior.  Touch it and the evolution menu appears.
Use the mousewheel or page up/down to select an evolution.  Press ALT-FIRE (impulse 13, bound to "x")
to evolve.  Select another weapon to free the cube.  Now requires archon power to operate.

Crates: wooden crates, large and small.  Hack open with your trusty axe or use any weapon.
Contains weapons and items.  Monsters are mostly helpers.

Runes: collect a rune to get its power.  "r" identifies runes you carry, and "y" drops them.
You can carry one of each variety.  Some combinations may not work.

Quantum tunnel apparatus: makes "holes" through quantum space.  Press ALT-FIRE to select the mode.
Experiment to find out how modes operate.  Mode 2, entry / exit is the standard method many are
familiar with.  (And yes, this thing existed long before the one you all know so well!)

Super gravity well: disaster maker extraordinare - throw this baby in a crowded room and get out.
Come back later and admire the vortex art!

Teleport sphere: comes from PK cubes.  Teleports you to a random location.
Great getaway.

Power points: on hub map, 4D in shape with a particle fountain.  Standing in one heals you and gives archon power.
They also spawn random weapons for the hub map.

Nodules: little colored bits that give archon power - Archons / Demi-archons get more power from them.

Hub map votes: (arc_hub map only) open the storage doors to reveal vote exits.  Enter one to vote on your favorite levels.

Maps: some new maps are provided.  A new score achievement system is in play.
You have to score 50 frags (on any map, just once) to unlock some maps.
Until the score achivement has been exceeded some voting doors on the Archon hub will not open!
(Note to admins: these maps can not be manually loaded with "map" or "changelevel" either!)

Random monsters: all the usual guys plus 6 new opponents.  If they dont come out of a cube, crate
or horn, they are your enemy.  If you have evolved, similar monsters will generally not attack
you.  Former soldiers will not attack player soldiers (such as Ranger - the quake marine.)
Some new monsters are violent and will attack all others.  Some are complacent (bossman) until
attacked.  Beware the bossman's tirades.  They are painful.

Melee mode: enter the alias "melee" in the server console to enable.  All ranged weapons are gone.  Good luck.
(Note: some morphs still have limited ranged attacks)

To enable these items consult the next section.  Entering "typical" in the console gives
typical options, generally turning all features on.  You must be on the server console.

Note: instructions refer to game default key bindings.  See "autoexec.cfg" and "config.cfg".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Archons:

Chaos and Order.

Once you become an Archon you will discover an entirely different game.

Your main adversary will be the other Archons and eventually demi-Archons.

Power:

Archons have two power levels - archon points and mana points.
The archon point bar is the yellow one and is only increased by:
1. power nodules, 2. power points, 3. God Particle.

When you are not an Archon, you also get XP for collecting items, using artifacts
and possessing runes.  XP needs converted and does not give much power.

The mana power bar is second to the archon power bar.  Mana power increases on its
own over time.  Events do affect it.  As Chaos mana increases Chaos will
have "star bursts."  Chaos power will flare up and all manner of things
will be ejected.  Some will be usable map items, some will be fake, some will
be bombs.  Even monsters can come from Chaos.

Orders mana will oppose Chaos.  The more mana Order has the greater effect
it will have in reducing Chaos on the levels.



You can only collect one item - power nodules.  And you need every one you can find.
You can NOT be hurt - Archons ignore health issues.

You can have your archon power level attacked - if it falls below zero
(either by attack or spell use) you will revert to:
1. your original form, or 2. your last polymorph self state.
Some attacks will take away a LOT of archon points.  Watch out for them.

Anything you want to do MUST be done by spell magic.
Attack is the main spell - with power bolts.

Move fast - teleport self spell.
Give yourself rune powers.  Note: rune powers have a constant power
usage requirement depending on the rune!
Summon helpers - you can have minions!


Chaos:

The main point of chaos is to sow confusion and dissent.
Chaos is a powerful force of nature.  When you fire the Chaos "beam"
chaotic things will happen at the strike point.
Chaos "star bursts" will litter levels with items, bombs, and
all manner of things.
Eventually when Chaos has enough mana - level wide total Chaos will ensue.

Chaos fires a random bolt shot.
ALT_FIRE (default key 'x') fires a beam of chaos energy.
Chaos beam has random and strange effects at the strike point.

Order:

The main point of order is to maintain the status quo.
Things will remain as they should normally be.
No extra map items, no extra monsters, no "stuff."
Order opposes Chaos at all times.
This does limit some of Orders spells.
When Order has enoough mana - all chaos items will be removed.
All map items will be restored.  Unwanted monsters will be banished.

Order has 3 attacks selectable on impulse 1:
1. laser type bolt (default) - uses 1 archon point
2. explosive bolt - uses 5 archon points
3. melee shell - short range, hits many targets
   - uses 10 points for 1 or 2 beings hit
   - uses 20 points for 3 or more hits


-------------------------------------------------------

Polymorphed forms:

Most morphs can collect and fire painkeep items.  This excludes - the air cannon, pulse nailgun and chain lightning gun.

Many morphs with weaker or limited attacks have had ranged attacks added (fiend)
and | or explosive shots (wizard, hell knight).

Exploding shots take archon points to fire and require a minimum archon power
before they are activated.  Once activated, however, you are free to use all
available archon power to fire them.

Lava bomb can turn into a smaller Cthon in any lava pool - jump in and ALT_FIRE (default key: x)
Lava bomb, and Cthon also heal very quickly in lava.
Consequently Cthon can NOT exist outside a lava pool, and Lava bomb is damaged by water.
